# English to Hindi Translation WebApp #
  This project is a WebApp for English to Hindi translation developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The app leverages the Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-hi model from Hugging Face for accurate translations and uses Gradio to create an interactive user interface. It is designed as a mini project to explore the use of pre-trained models for NLP tasks.
