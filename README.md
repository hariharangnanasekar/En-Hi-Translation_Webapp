# English to Hindi Translation WebApp #
  This project is a WebApp for English to Hindi translation developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The app leverages the Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-hi model from Hugging Face for accurate translations and uses Gradio to create an interactive user interface. It is designed as a mini project to explore the use of pre-trained models for NLP tasks.

## Features
English to Hindi Translation: Converts English text into Hindi using a pre-trained transformer model.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Gradio for seamless interaction.

## Technologies Used
Python

Transformers: For accessing pre-trained NLP models.

Gradio: For creating the user interface.

PyTorch: As the underlying framework for running the model

## Acknowledgments
Hugging Face: For providing the Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-hi translation model.

Gradio: For simplifying the creation of user-friendly interfaces.
